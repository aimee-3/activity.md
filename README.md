1.Have you ever used GitHub before? Yes/No
  I have never used Github before

2.Explain - in your own words - what is meant by "version control"
  It documents changed/edits made to the code

3.Commit the change, add a comment about what it is
  I think the difference is that GIT is the actual program and GITHUB is a place for people to use and develop their skills for GIT
